 A number cruncher that determines the amount of carbon emitted by you, and provides ways to reduce it

## Getting Started - Building and running Carbon Check

To run a local developement build of Carbon Check on your local machine, make sure to have the following dependencies installed:-
- NPM (or yarn)
- Next.js
- React DOM
-

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.js`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Contributing

Whether it is a small documentation correction, bug fix or a new feature, contributions are highly appreciated. It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any significant new ideas. Please check with us before spending too much time, only to find out later that someone else is already working on a similar feature.

`main` branch is the current working branch. Please send your PR's to `main` branch, making sure that it builds on your local system successfully. Also, please make sure all the conflicts are resolved.
