                        A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon
                        dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.
                    </p>

                    <p className='floating'>
                        The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons,
                        one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint
                        is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global
                        temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.

                    <p className='floating'>
                        Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn't happen
                        overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking
                        fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
